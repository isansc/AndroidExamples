Traein
===

Android app targeting API 8 and above, displaying Irish Rails timetables. This was a 3 day project, so it lacks some functionality and UI enhancements.

What it does?
---

Selecting a desired station, it shows all trains due to serve the named station in the next 90 minutes. Stations can
be marked as favorites. Live Feed is also available, displaying current train movements.

3rd Party Libraries
---

 - Android Support v4
 - SimpleXML
 - Volley
 - ActionBarCompat

The last library should be added as a module dependency since it contains UI resources. Other three are available in
the libs folder.
