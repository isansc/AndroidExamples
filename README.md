Android Examples
===

This is a collection of simple apps with solutions to common problems faced during the development. Unless stated otherwise,
all apps are targeting **API level 8**. Many of them are using `android.support.v4` package.

Each example contains a brief description and if you're lucky, even an explanation behind the solution.

Note that this is a work in progress and updated fairly regularly (usualy during the weekend).

All code inside this directoy is in public domain. Use at your own risk.
