Android Examples
===

A collection of simplified apps demonstrating various Android functionality I used during development.
Unless stated otherwise, all apps are targeting **API level 8**. Many of them are using `android.support.v4` package.

Each example contains a brief description and if you're lucky, even an explanation behind the solution.

This is a work in progress and updated fairly regularly.
